# wvubeamer
This repository provides a beamer theme based on the WVU Statler College Powerpoint Presentation theme, intended for use by members of WVU Robotics.

This theme is a modified version of the wvubeamer theme, originally developed by Andrew J. Liounis and is forked from [WVU-ASEL/wvubeamer](https://github.com/WVU-ASEL/wvubeamer)
